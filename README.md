Face Detection and Webcam Access Project
This simple Flask-based project demonstrates webcam access and real-time face detection. The project consists of two main files:

app.py:

This file initializes a Flask application and sets up a route to access the webcam feed.
It utilizes the OpenCV library to capture video frames from the webcam and convert them into JPEG format.
The frames are continuously streamed to the web browser using the Flask Response class, creating a live video feed.
detect.py:

This file is designed to work in conjunction with app.py.
It contains additional functionality for face detection using Haar Cascades.
The face detection is applied to each frame captured from the webcam, providing a real-time visualization of detected faces.
Project Setup
Installation:

Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Install the required libraries using the following command:
bash
Copy code
pip install flask opencv-python
Run the Application:

Execute the app.py file to start the Flask application.
bash
Copy code
python app.py
Access the live webcam feed by visiting http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your web browser.
Webcam Access:

The main page provides access to the webcam feed.
Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to view the webcam stream.
Face Detection:

The detect.py file contains code for real-time face detection using Haar Cascades.
This feature can be incorporated into the project to enhance it further.
Additional Information
Project Files:

app.py: Manages the Flask web application and webcam access.
detect.py: Contains face-detection features that can be integrated with the main application.
Usage:

Run app.py to start the web application.
Access the webcam feed at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
Further improvements can be made by integrating face detection features from detect.py.
Feel free to explore and enhance this project based on your requirements!
